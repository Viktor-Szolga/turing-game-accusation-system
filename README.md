# Reverse Turing Game Classifier â€“ Bachelor Thesis
This repository contains the code, trained models, and experiment configurations used for my bachelor thesis. It provides all scripts and data required to recreate the experimental results and plots described in the thesis.

## Installation
The project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Viktor-Szolga/turing-game-accusation-system.git
   cd turing-game-accusation-system
   ```

2. Create the environment with Poetry:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install from the frozen requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_freeze.txt
   ```

## Running Experiments
The main entry point for all experiments is:
```bash
python main.py
```
This script:
- Trains all classifiers with different configurations as described in the thesis.
- Stores results and model checkpoints in the appropriate folders.

All experiment configurations are stored as YAML files in the `experiments/` folder.

## Trained Models
- All trained model state dictionaries are saved in the `trained_models/` directory.
- The final model selected in the thesis is:

  `trained_models/run082.pth`

## Data and Preprocessing
- **BoW Encodings:** To calculate the Bag of Words encodings used run:
```bash
python BoW_encodings.py
```
- **Sentence Embeddings:** Precomputed encodings are included in the repository. (They were originally generated via `encode_data.ipynb`, which connects to a local server and therefore cannot be rerun directly.)

## Recreating Plots
Use `create_plots.py` and `create_plots_manually.py` to generate the visualizations from the thesis:

Make sure to set the variables correctly using the information in `create_plots_manually_variables.py`.

## Analysis and Evaluation
The repository also includes notebooks with the analysis and evaluation performed during the thesis:

- `analysis/data_analysis.ipynb`: Contains the data exploration and analysis steps.
- `analysis/classifier_evaluation.ipynb`: Contains the evaluation of the trained classifiers.

The analysis in classifier_evaluation requires the encoding model running on the Turing Game server.
